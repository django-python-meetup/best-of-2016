# Top 10 Python projects of 2016

We selected what we thought were the best, funniest, or most useful python projects that were released in 2016.

Our rules were that the package had to be pushed to github for the first time in 2016 as shown in these github search results:

Fabric3 would have made my list, since I believe it was released in 2016; however, it didn't meet our github query parameters and it wasn't clear that the fork was actually made in January or December of 2015.
